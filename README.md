*Pitch*
In the era of IoT, it's become a lot easier to go to a new city (or even the one you live in) and learn about its history,  architecture, or culture.  Now with moto.host, your new mobile tour host, it's become even easier.  

*App Structure*
 - In a city, open app and take picture of what you want to learn more about.
  * Create app
  * Take picture in react native
  * Use clarifai API to see what's in picture
  * Use geolocation from phone
  * Use open data and wiki to read more information about that particular area/thing/stuff.
 - If we have time:
  * Use AR 
  * Work on ui/ux
  * Camera with fingers
